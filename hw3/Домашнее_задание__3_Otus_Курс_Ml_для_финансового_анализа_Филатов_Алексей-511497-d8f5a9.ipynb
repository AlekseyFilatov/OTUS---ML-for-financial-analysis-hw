        "           n_trades: Количество сделок, совершенных за период тестирования. Показывает активность стратегии. Большое количество сделок может указывать на высокую частоту торговли, что может быть как преимуществом, так и недостатком в зависимости от контекста.\n",
        "           returns: Общая доходность стратегии в процентах за период тестирования. Основной показатель прибыльности стратегии. Положительная доходность указывает на успешность стратегии, отрицательная — на убыточность.\n",
        "           max_drawdown: Максимальная просадка капитала за период тестирования. Показывает наибольшее падение капитала от пика до минимума. Используется для оценки риска стратегии. Чем меньше просадка, тем стабильнее стратегия.\n",
        "           win_rate: Процент прибыльных сделок от общего количества сделок. Показывает, насколько часто стратегия приносит прибыль. Высокий процент выигрышных сделок может указывать на стабильность стратегии.\n",

Используется для сравнения стратегий с учетом риска. Высокий коэффициент Шарпа указывает на эффективное использование риска.\n",
        "           sortino_ratio: Коэффициент Сортино, который измеряет доходность с поправкой на риск, учитывая только негативную волатильность. Аналогичен коэффициенту Шарпа, но фокусируется на риске убытков, что делает его более подходящим для оценки стратегий с асимметричным распределением доходности.\n",
        "           profit_factor: Отношение общей прибыли к общему убытку. Показывает, насколько прибыльна стратегия по сравнению с убытками. Используется для оценки соотношения прибыли и убытков. Значение больше 1 указывает на прибыльность стратегии.\n",
